# Paperclip Surfers

> **Self-improving AI agent companies** — a V3 fork of [paperclipai/paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) with persistent memory, MCP support, skills management, a self-improvement loop, and the AMX LABS Ecosystem Expansion.

## What's new in V2

[Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) is an open-source control plane for AI agent companies. This fork adds:

### Persistent Conversations
Agents resume the same Claude Code conversation across all tasks within a project — no more starting fresh every run. Comments on tasks, new assignments, and wakeups all continue the same session.

### Agent Memory
Agents accumulate knowledge that persists across sessions:
- **Global memory** — cross-project learnings, CEO/board feedback, preferences
- **Project memory** — codebase patterns, team preferences, prior decisions
- Memory is automatically injected into every agent run as system prompt context

### MCP Integration
- **Sync from Claude Code** — discovers MCP servers you've already configured in `~/.claude.json` (one click)
- **Per-agent assignment** — assign specific MCPs to specific agents (CEO gets Slack, DevOps gets AWS)
- **Company defaults** — set MCPs for all agents, with per-agent overrides
- At runtime, `--mcp-config` is automatically passed to the Claude CLI

### Skills Selector
- User-installed skills from `~/.claude/skills` are now selectable per agent
- Checkbox UI in agent settings — toggle skills on/off per agent
- Selected skills are symlinked into the agent's execution directory at runtime

### Self-Improvement Loop
- **Post-run KPIs** — every run records: completion status, tokens, cost, duration, errors
- **Observations** — CEO agent or board humans log patterns they notice over time
- **Experiments** — opt-in A/B testing of approaches per agent
- **Analytics page** — company-wide performance trends across all agents

### AMX LABS Ecosystem Expansion (V3) — by Zohund
Built by Zohund on top of the V2 AMX LABS foundation. Industrial-grade integration for the AMX ecosystem, moving beyond orchestration into production and verified auditing:
- **XP Exchange** — Dynamic earner marketplace with real-time XP tracking and human-agent payout settlement.
- **AMX Chain Explorer** — Proof of Work auditing on an immutable ledger. Verifiable security events and cryptographic certificates for all agent deliverables.
- **RQ Portal** — Advanced "Requirement" submission system for Industrial AI context seeding and deployment mode selection (Online, Physical, Metaverse).
- **LMS Dashboard (Tech at Nite)** — Integrated learning management system for up-skilling through workshops and simulations (e.g., Louisville FoodPort).
- **Industrialized Backend** — Fully persistent Express API routes integrated with AMX service layers, replacing mock data with real-time production telemetry.

## Using the V2 features

### Sync your MCPs
1. Open the board → **MCPs** in sidebar
2. Click **Sync from Claude Code**
3. Your authenticated MCPs appear — check which to import
4. Assign to company (all agents) or specific agents

### Give an agent memory
1. Open an agent → **Memory** tab
2. Click **Add Memory** — choose global or project scope
3. Memory is injected every time the agent runs

### Select skills per agent
1. Open an agent → **Skills** tab
2. User-installed skills from `~/.claude/skills` appear with checkboxes
3. Check the skills this agent should have access to

### View agent performance
1. Open an agent → **Performance** tab
2. See KPI trends, add observations, track experiments
